        Making Pizza Dough
        In a large measuring cup, add water, active dry yeast, and sugar. Stir and allow it to sit for 10 minutes at room temperature until it gets foamy.
In a large bowl, add flour, salt, olive oil, and foamy yeast mixture.
Knead the dough using your hands or a stand mixer with a dough hook for 5-10 minutes or until the dough is smooth and no longer sticky.
Place the dough ball in a greased bowl. Cover with plastic wrap and let it rest/rise for 1 hour or until it’s doubled in size.
         Make The Pizza Sauce
In a large saucepan, heat oil at medium-high heat. Sauté bell peppers, onions, and garlic for 3-4 minutes.
Add tomatoes, brown sugar, salt, smoked paprika, dried oregano, black pepper, and bay leaf. Stir to combine. Bring to a boil, uncovered, then reduce heat. Simmer for about 25-30 minutes.
Remove the sauce from the heat and remove the bay leaf. Using an immersion blender, blend the sauce until completely liquid. Taste and adjust seasonings. Transfer to a bowl. Set aside.
Make The Pizzas
Preheat the oven to 400ºF. Lightly grease four 9-inch pie plates with olive oil. Set aside.
Lightly dust a clean work surface with flour and transfer your dough from the bowl. Evenly divide the dough into 4 parts.
Press the dough down onto each pie plate until it reaches the edges of the plate.
Spoon the pizza sauce over the dough and spread using the back of a spoon to the edges of the plate.
Sprinkle a thin layer of cheese over the sauce to the edges of the plate. Those crispy burnt edges of cheese are a good thing!
Add the ground chorizo to your liking and sliced onions. Cover the toppings with more cheese on top. Repeat with remaining pizzas with toppings of your choice.
Bake the pizzas for 15-18 minutes or until the cheese is melted and the edges of the pizzas are golden brown.
Slide a butter knife around the edges of the pie plate to separate the pizza from the edge. Transfer the pizza to a plate. Enjoy! -->
